# Big Block Timer

## Simplest Possible Valuable Product
After the user enters an activity name and an amount of time, a solid-color screen appears with the name of the activity and a live timer that is counting down. 

TO DO: show "done" message at end of timer. 
SetInterval is likely what's needed here.
